Real Time Traffic Congestion Management

Introduction
Time Traffic Congestion Management is an innovative project designed to manage urban traffic congestion dynamically. 
The system uses live data feeds and machine learning algorithms to allocate signal times efficiently based on vehicle counts and traffic density.

Features

Live Data Feed: Captures live feed from traffic cameras.

Vehicle Categorization: Counts the number of vehicles as:
LV: Light vehicles (e.g., cars,auto).
HV: Heavy vehicles (e.g., trucks, buses).
2-Wheeler: Motorcycles and scooters.

Dynamic Signal Allocation: Allocates green signal times dynamically based on vehicle categories using machine learning.

User Interface: Displays vehicle counts and signal timings in an easy-to-use interface.
